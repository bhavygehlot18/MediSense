# Smart-Emotion-Analysis-Web-Platform-for-Healthcare-Consultations
A real-time emotion detection and analytics platform designed for counselors, therapists, and psychologists. It uses React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Python (Flask) with deep learning to analyze emotions from webcam video and visualize engagement.

# Features
- **Doctor/Patient Module:** Track and visualize patient emotions during sessions to help doctors understand patient feelings and reactions.
- **Teacher/Student Module:** Monitor student emotions and activeness during classes to help teachers assess engagement.
- **Real-time Emotion Detection:** Uses webcam and deep learning models for live emotion recognition.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize emotion trends and session data.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for different user roles.

# Project Structure
- `backend/` — Node.js/Express API server (auth, MongoDB, session management)
- `frontend/` — React app (UI, dashboard, video, analytics) and Python Flask server (emotion detection)

# Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB (cloud or local)

# Getting Started

## 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Advance-Emotion-Detection-WebApp-main
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

## Backend (Node.js)
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Frontend (React & Python)
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Configure Environment Variables

- Edit `backend/.env` for MongoDB URI, JWT secret, email, etc.
- Edit `frontend/.env` for API URLs and model paths if needed.

## 4. Start the Servers

## Start Node.js Backend (Port 5000 by default)
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

## Start Python Backend (Flask, Port 5005 by default)
```bash
cd ../frontend
python app.py
```

## Start React Frontend (Vite, Port 5173 by default)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 5. Access the Application

- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

# Usage
- Register or log in as a doctor, patient, teacher, or student.
- Start a session to record and analyze emotions in real time.
- View analytics and emotion trends on the dashboard.

# Notes
- Ensure all three servers (Node.js, Python, React) are running for full functionality.
- The Python backend handles real-time emotion detection and must be running for webcam features.
- MongoDB must be accessible as configured in `backend/.env`.
